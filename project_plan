url mapping in main.py
handlers in (various) foo_handler.py
    login -> login.py -> login.html -> return cookie -> redirect to frontpage
    signup -> signup.py -> signup.html > return cookie -> redirect to frontpage (last page?)
    logout -> remove cookie -> redirect to frontpage
    frontpage -> frontpage.py  (is frontpage just a type of 'otherpage' = page)
                                YES!
    otherpage -> otherpage.py ->
        foo_page -> calling some content by page-name foo_contents in page template
    _edit/otherpage
    _history/otherpage
models:
    users, contains [username, pw-hash, (email), created_date ]
    page, contains [(title)?, content, created_date, author]
                [page_history?] look at datastore and parents
                consider having page_history be a link to 
                linked list of data items (history)
            make each new version of a page a child of the previous
            page. Each page has it's 'created_date' which can be
            used for the history
    address (?) - for url handlers, if address in address_database
                return relevant data
                else make new page (edit page)
                (? create before and after  or only after
                submission of edit?)
